rulesField=In this game you roll the dice just once.  If this total is 3, 4, 9, 10 or 11, then you win the amount of the bet. If the total is 2, then you win double the bet. If this total is 12, then you win triple the bet. For any other total of the dice (5, 6, 7, or 8), you lose the amount of the bet.
rulesPass=In this game you roll the dice (called the come-out roll) and look at the total. If this total is equal to 7 or 11, then you win the amount of the bet. If the total is equal to 2, 3 or 12, then you lose the bet. Any other total of the dice becomes the "point", and you continue to roll the dice until you either (a) roll the point total again, in which case you win the amount of the bet, or (b) roll a total of 7, in which case you lose the amount of the bet. If the total of the dice is not 7 and not equal to the point, then you roll again, and continue to roll, until either condition (a) or (b) is met. Once the point has been determined, it does not change for subsequent rolls of the dice.
rulesAny=In this game you roll the dice just once. If this total is equal to 7, then you win quadruple the bet. For any other total of the dice, you lose the amount of the bet.
